Your sample should be developed as a C# Web Api endpoint with an optional JavaScript front end and
should be posted to GitHub for review. Please provide your recruiter with the link for the source code. If
preferable, you can opt for a light technical exercise on a white board at the time of the technical
interview.

Geometric layouts

1.A - The task, calculate the triangle coordinates for an image with right triangles such that for a given
row (A-F) and column (1-12) you can produce any of the triangles in the layout below:
